A small app which chooses a random album to play from your liked album library.

For conda on linux, you may need to run:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gtk3 pygobject
```

### Installing

- Create the environment: `conda create -n spotify-random-album -c conda-forge meson gtk3 pygobject python=3.11 -y`
- Install briefcase: `pip install briefcase`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`
- Run the app: `briefcase dev`

### How to build and run

1. Populate the `.env` file (and then the `src/spotifyrandom/env.py` file)
2. Plug in an Android phone with debugging enabled
3. Set Android USB to "File Transfer"
4. Run the app locally once (via `briefcase dev`) so it generates a `cache-spoitpy.json` file
5. Run `briefcase create android`
6. Run `briefcase build android -u`
7. Run `briefcase run android`

## Original script

It also needs the following environment variables in order to run:
